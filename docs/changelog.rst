 Doctr Changelog
=================

Current
=======
- Error/warn user if ``doctr configure`` is run not at root of git repo
  (:issue:`162`)
- The ``--gh-pages-docs`` flag of ``doctr deploy`` has been deprecated.
  Specify the deploy directory like ``doctr deploy .`` or ``doctr deploy docs``.
  There is also no longer a default deploy directory. (:issue:`128`)
- ``setup_GitHub_push`` now takes a ``branch_whitelist`` parameter instead of
  of a ``require_master``
- ``.travis.yml`` can be used to store some of doctr configuration in addition
  to the command line flags. Write doctr configuration under the ``doctr`` key.
  :issue:`137`
- All boolean command line flags now have a their counterpart that can overwrite
  the config values set in ``.travis.yml``

1.4.1 (2017-01-11)

- Explicitly pull from ``doctr_remote`` on Travis. (:issue:`147`)
- Don't attempt to push ``gh-pages`` to the remote when pushing is disallowed
  (e.g., on a pull request). (:issue:`150`)

  latest versions of git. (:issue:`138`, :issue:`139`)
- Add more information to the automated commit messages. (:issue:`134`)
- Run doctr tests on Travis with a personal access token, avoiding rate
  limiting errors. (:issue:`133`)

  :issue:`130`)
- Use the latest version of sphinxcontrib.autoprogram to build the doctr docs.
  (:issue:`127`)

================

Major Changes
-------------

  it was done in ``push_docs``). (:issue:`92`)

  is done separately in ``__main__.py``. The Python API for ``commit_docs`` is
  now ``commit_docs(*, added, removed)``. (:issue:`92`)

  files. (:issue:`92`)
